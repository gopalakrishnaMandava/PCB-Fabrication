# PCB-Fabrication

First load the design into bantam tools software select the Top, Bottom, Outline, Holes files individually.
Top : F_Cu.gbr
Bottom : B_Cu.gbr
Outline : Edge_cuts.gbr
Holes : Module_PTH.drl

Step 1: Mill the holes so that we can make the inner side of holes to be copper plated for contact between top and bottom layer of PCB
Step 2: Follow the procedures of LPKF galvanic through hole platter.
Step 3: Etch the traces for top layer & flip the PCB and align as required from left to right.
Step 4: Etch the traces on bottom & then outlines.
